**Current State:** Caskr is a promising MVP with modern tech but lacks enterprise features. I wouldn't risk my $10M operation on it today.

**Future State (18 months):** With P1 features complete, Caskr becomes a serious contender for $1M-$20M distilleries. At $1,999/month vs $10K+ for DRAMS/Bevica, it's an obvious choice for cost-conscious growth-stage operations.

**Recommendation:** Execute the 18-month plan. Focus ruthlessly on P1 features. Win craft and growth-stage distilleries. Establish enterprise credibility. Then compete for larger deals.

The market opportunity is real. The technology foundation is solid. The execution roadmap is clear.

**Make it happen.**
