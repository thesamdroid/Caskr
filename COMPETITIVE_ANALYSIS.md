### 2. Defined Pricing Tiers ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL (Business Decision)

**Current State:** Infrastructure complete, tiers NOT populated
**Required State:** Clear tiered pricing visible on website

**Why Critical:**
- Sales team cannot close deals without pricing
- Prospects cannot evaluate ROI
- Infrastructure is ready - just needs data!

**Detailed Task List:**
```
PRICE-001: Define pricing tiers (BUSINESS DECISION)
├── Craft tier: $X/month (1-2 locations, basic features)
├── Growth tier: $X/month (3-5 locations, full features)
├── Professional tier: $X/month (unlimited, priority support)
└── Enterprise tier: Contact sales (custom SLA)

PRICE-002: Populate PricingTier database table
├── Insert tier definitions

```

**Investment:** $10K-$20K for ticketing system (or use existing tools)

**Investment:** $30K-$40K
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks

---

### 5. Native Mobile App ⭐⭐ LOWER PRIORITY (Optional Enhancement)

**Current State:** Full PWA with barcode scanning and offline support
**Required State:** Native iOS/Android apps (optional enhancement)

**Why Lower Priority:**

```

**Investment:** $80K-$120K
**Timeline:** 3-4 months
**Note:** Defer until customer demand validates need over PWA

---

## Deferred Features (Not Required for US MVP)

### ~~Warehouse Management (3D Visualization)~~ - DEFERRED

**Status:** Complete! Full portal application deployed
**Features:** Fractional ownership, document management, maturation tracking

### ~~Xero Integration~~ - N/A (US Market)
